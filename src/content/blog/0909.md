## What is Props Drilling in React?

Props drilling is a common issue in React applications where data is passed through multiple layers of components. This happens when a component higher up in the tree needs access to data that is defined at a lower level. Instead of lifting the state up to a common ancestor, props are passed down through each intermediate component, leading to repetitive and potentially messy code.

### Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate props drilling. Suppose we have a nested component structure with a `User` component at the top level and a `Button` component at the bottom level. The `Button` component needs to access a `theme` prop that is defined in the `App` component.

```jsx
const App = () => {
    const theme = 'light';
    return (
        <div>
            <User theme={theme} />
        </div>
    );
};

const User = ({ theme }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Button theme={theme} />
        </div>
    );
};

const Button = ({ theme }) => {
    return (
        <button style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? 'white' : 'black' }}>
            Click me
        </button>
    );
};
```

In this example, the `theme` prop is passed from the `App` component to the `User` component, and then to the `Button` component. This is a simple example, but it can quickly become a problem in larger applications, especially when dealing with more complex data structures.

## How to Avoid Props Drilling

1. **Context API**: The Context API provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props through intermediate components.

2. **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks can be used to encapsulate state and logic, allowing for more reusable and modular code.

3. **State Management Libraries**: Libraries like Redux, MobX, or Zustand can help manage state in a centralized way, reducing the need for props drilling.

### Example with Context API

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => {
    const theme = 'light';
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
            <User />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
};

const User = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Button />
        </div>
    );
};

const Button = () => {
    const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
    return (
        <button style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? 'white' : 'black' }}>
            Click me
        </button>
    );
};
```

In this example, the `theme` prop is provided at the `App` component level and accessed using the `useContext` hook in the `Button` component. This avoids the need to pass the prop through intermediate components.
